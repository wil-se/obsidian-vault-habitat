[[Habitat Studio]]

We declare and feel ourselves as promoters of ideas, inspiration, art, beauty, harmony of interiors and exteriors, but we also want to be promoters of the principle according to which "every human being should have a decent place where to live ‚Äù, which he can call home.
We therefore want to commit ourselves to donating a percentage of income to the humanitarian associations that deal with this: associations such as Habitat For Humanity, which has nothing to do with our project, but we embrace its cause, are exactly the target of associations that we would like to go and support with our donations.
Also in this case we are open to collaborations, subject to guarantees and certifications, with humanitarian associations that want to help others and that can demonstrate their benevolent intentions.
