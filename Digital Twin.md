# Digital Twin
---
A digital twin is a virtual replica of physical, potential and actual resources (physical twin) equivalent to objects, processes, people, places, infrastructures, systems and devices. We want to turn this concept around by giving an additional exclusive possibility, to those who want it and with a cost to be agreed in the design phase, to physically create a 3D product purchased from our store, through the purchase of an NFT contract called "Digital Twin Contract ". We have skilled craftsmen in the realization on project, ready to satisfy the customer's requests, to provide a product of high craftsmanship Made in Italy. Thus managing to intertwine the real dimension and the virtual dimension, going through all the phases of creation, production (manufacture) and delivery of the finished product, with worldwide shipping.
The "Digital Twin Contract" will be the certification that will allow the customer to interface privately with one of our professionals, with whom the product will be studied.

It is clear that a tangible product will fit into a finished real environment, therefore all aspects concerning the object will be agreed with the customer: in the case of a sofa, for example, the upholstery materials, padding, structures, dimensions, configurations and colors can be chosen, ensuring the maximum customization experience.

 It will be possible to see and understand what the products you want to create are using virtual space and simulation.
 The Digital Twin Contract can only be applied to exclusive products bearing the words "Digital Twin âœ“" in the NFT metadata, because we want the purchaser of these NFTs to have total exclusivity on a product and the guarantee that only they can have it all over the world.
 
 If he were to sell it, he will do so with the awareness that the buyer can in turn purchase the "Digital Twin Contract" and use it on the NFT he has purchased, but the new owner will not be able to have a product identical to that of the previous owner, so as to maintain the uniqueness and exclusivity of each product, without causing a devaluation.

This implies that if you resell the NFT other people will have the opportunity to make replicas of the product, so holding the NFT means preserving and increasing the value of your physical asset.
