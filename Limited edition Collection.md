# Limited edition Collection
---
A limited edition NFT could be a [[Furniture]] or a [[Land]]. They will be deployed as [[ERC 721]] contracts and some of them will have the [[Digital Twin]] option.
Those are the most valuable (and expensive) pieces of art made by [[Habitat Studio]] and other [[Partnership with other studios|famous studios]].
There will be a few pieces of this kind of collection to achieve scarcity, each one will be different from others.
Limited edition's owners will receive the most advantageous gain from the rewarding system.
For each new minted Limited edition NFT the buyer will receive also some [[Governance Token]]s.
