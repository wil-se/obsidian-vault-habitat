# Land
---
A land is a NFT ([[ERC 721]] or [[ERC 1155]]) which represents an empty house. It can be used in metaverses which support NFTs such as spatial.io. Their function is to give a home to a user, where he will be able to place NFT furnitures and more generally any kind of object compatible with the metaverse.
Lands will be created by [[Habitat Studio]] or in [[Partnership with other studios]].
In a future version of the project there will be the [[Habitat Studio]] metaverse.
There it will be possible to expand lands utility, since we're the owners of the metaverse.
