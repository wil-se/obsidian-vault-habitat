# MetavExpo
[[Habitat Studio]]
[[Rewards]]

"MetavExpo" is a term coined by the union of the words "Metaverse" and "Expo" and embodies the very meaning of this part of the Habitat Studio project: the creation of an Event that aims to raise public awareness in the field of interior design in both the IT and physical fields,  encouraging progress and transmitting experiences.

The MetavExpo aims to [[Partnership with other studios|connect]] a wide audience, including influential persons, experts, artists, investors, so that they can communicate internationally, creating and at the same time economic and working opportunities: this would allow participants to share their works, ideas, culture and products to an international audience. In this way, exhibitors will contribute not only to the development of their image, but also and above all to the development of their activities at an international level.

It will obviously also be open to companies in the real estate sector, who will be able to participate in the events by expanding their markets, coming into contact with other companies and organizations and finding investment opportunities with a new audience.

MetavExpo is a place of education, business and entertainment.
The idea is to also organize numerous activities, such as conferences, exhibitions and VIP lounges for our Investors and Partners.
The Expo area will be structured and presented within a single meta-existing structure, which will be designated according to the possibilities it offers, wanting to guarantee visitors a unique experience.
